Employee Management System
Description
The Employee Management System is a RESTful API built with Flask for efficiently managing employee information. It provides full CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for employee records, ensuring streamlined and organized data handling. The system leverages SQLAlchemy for database interactions and Marshmallow for data validation.

Features
CRUD Operations: Add, retrieve, update, and delete employee records.
Database Support: Uses SQLite by default, with easy configuration for other databases.
Modular Structure: Clean organization for scalability and maintenance.
Testing Ready: API is accessible for testing with tools like Postman or Curl.

Testing
Use tools like Postman or Curl to test each endpoint.
For automated testing, consider using pytest with Flask’s testing client.
Future Enhancements
Authentication: Implement role-based access control.
Database Migrations: Use Flask-Migrate for database version control.
Advanced Filtering: Add filters to retrieve specific employee data.

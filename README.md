# Employee Management System

This project provides a RESTful API for managing employee records. Built using Python and Flask, it supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for employee information and leverages SQLAlchemy for database interaction and Marshmallow for data validation.

## Project Overview

The Employee Management System is a simple application designed to manage employee data in an organization. It allows users to add, update, retrieve, and delete employee records through a RESTful API. The system is built using Flask and follows best practices in API design, ensuring easy scalability and maintenance.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Enables adding, updating, retrieving, and deleting employee records.
- **Database Support**: Uses SQLite by default, with support for configuring other databases.
- **Modular Design**: The application is structured for easy maintenance and scalability.
- **Testing Ready**: The API can be tested using tools like Postman or Curl.
- **RESTful API**: Access employee data using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smruti030/employee-management-system.git
   cd employee-management-system

### Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

### Install dependencies:

1.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

### Set up the database:

The application uses SQLite by default, but you can modify config.py for other databases.
Initialize the database with the following command:

2.
   ```bash
   python -c "from app import db; db.create_all()"

## Usage
Run the Flask application:

3.
   ```bash
   python app.py
   
## Test the API:

GET /employees: Retrieve all employees.
POST /employees: Add a new employee.
PUT /employees/<id>: Update an employee's information by ID.
DELETE /employees/<id>: Delete an employee by ID.
Example cURL command to create a new employee:

4.
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/employees -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "John Doe", "position": "Developer", "department": "Engineering"}'

## Testing
You can use tools like Postman or Curl to interact with the API. For automated testing, consider using pytest with Flask’s testing client to ensure the reliability of your endpoints.

## Future Enhancements
Authentication: Implement role-based access control.
Database Migrations: Use Flask-Migrate for schema migrations.
Advanced Filtering: Add filtering features for employee data retrieval.
